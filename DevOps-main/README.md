# Details DevOps Repo

This repository holds the Devops Resources, it holds the yaml files for the pipelines in the [Dev Ops Pipelines Section](https://dev.azure.com/OrgName/Sample_Rackspace/_build)

More Information about yaml based pipelines can be found on the [Microsoft Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema) 

**Table of Contents**
[[_TOC_]] 

## Repo File Structure 

The way this Repo us organized is that Pipeline yaml files are grouped by Project in to folders, for instance the API Pipelines and grouped in to the folders: 

.\Sample-API-Pipelines
.\Sample-Core-Pipelines

Within the Folder the Pipeline files are grouped by the Pipeline type for instance a Folder named CI for Continues Integration or named Release, each Pipeline has a yaml file that holds the tasks of the pipeline as well as templates to make common tasks reusable between the pipelines.

The yaml Pipeline files have the file extension *.pipeline.yml and the templates *.template.yml to make it easier to differentiate between them.

The Templates will in the lowest folder of which they are shared with so for example a template used by the CI and Release Pipeline of the API will be within the API folder while a template used by the API and Core Project will be at the root in a folder called .\SharedResources

## Documentation Standards and Auto Generated Content

This Documentation is Generated by the ./RegenerateReadMe.ps1 Powershell Script.
In order to have the Documentation regenareated after each commit, copy the "pre-commit(copy me in to Git-Hooks folder)" file in to the git/hooks folder and rename it to "pre-commit"
This will let the git client that you are using know to execute the ./RegenerateReadMe.ps1 file, hence regenerate the documentation

It is composed of the content of the __Readme.md file as well as a list, the script Generates, of all Yaml Pipeline and Template Files.

The List of all the Yaml Pipeline and template files contains details of the purpose and useful information like Parameters needed for each of the Templates listed.

Each Pipeline and template contains xml tags with a summery of the files purpose and useful Information like:
- Details on the purpose of the File
- Templates used in the Pipeline
- Parameters used for Templates
- and other useful information

The Script gets the Information from xml tags in the Pipeline files

for example the the summary and remarks tags from the release pipeline

## Sample-Shared.pipeline.yml

### summary

 To share and reuse code between the solutions we use the Sample-Shared pipeline to pack the shared code into NuGet Packages. The generated packages can then be consumed from multiple solutions and projects.
 For example, the Sample Core Solution has the code to access the Database and the Sample API Solution reuses this code.
 In order to make the shared code available as NuGet Packages, the Sample-Shared Pipeline builds and publishes the shared code. As an example, we run the following steps in the Pipeline for the DataAccess Project.
 1. Build the DataAccess Project
 2. Package it as a NuGet Package
 3. Upload it to a shared artifact feed
 4. Add the NuGet package with a reference to the Sample API Solutionâ€™s Web Project
 
### remarks

### ToDo

 In order for Debug Symbols and sourceLink info to work the project files need to be migrated
 to the new project file layout, please follow the instructions in ticket 2943 / confluence
 reenable code on line 44 and 134

## Build-Pack-LegacyStyle.Template.yml

### summary

 This Template will build and package projects that are based on the old project file layout,

  - { Name: 'BackgroundProcessing', NameSpace: '', PackageNS: 'OrgName.Sample-Core' }

 Where IsWebProj will copy js and css files to the package, SourceDir is used as root for the copying of the css and js files
 NameSpace is referring to the Project namespace for example InfoExchange2.{ProjectName} 
 while PackageNS is for the NuGet package and can be for example Sample.{ProjectName}

 the description shows in the NuGet feed and package manager
 RunGulp parameter property is to install npm and run the gulp tasks
